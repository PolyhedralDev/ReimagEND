terrain-configuration:
  island-scale: 1
  # Scale of default terrain
  # Default: 1

  island-max-height: 250
  # Max height of default terrain
  # Default: 250

  island-min-height: -40
  # Lowest height of default terrain
  # Default: 250

  island-undercarriage-translate: -10
  # Translate placement of default terrain undercarriage
  # Default: -10

  island-flatness: 5
  # Flatness of default terrain
  # Default: 5

  island-taper: 100
  # Range for narrowing deafault terrain
  # Default: 100

  island-threshold: 0.4
  # Threshold or density of default island
  # Default: 0.4


biome-distribution:
  # Biome distribution refers to the placement of biomes, this does *NOT*
  # include aspects like terrain height / shape within biomes, or anything
  # else that generates within any given biome.
  
  # These parameters are designed to allow for easy modification of biome distribution,
  # and are injected into the various biome distribution configs via meta-configuration.
  # You can find these configs in the biome-providers directory, most of which contain
  # additional more specific parameters. 

  global-scale: 1
  # Modifies the scale of everything, you can use this parameter to if you
  # want just about every biome to be larger or smaller.
  # By doubling the scale, you double the length & width of everything,
  # e.g. if you have a biome that is 300 blocks wide with a scale of 1, and
  # increase that scale to 2, that biome will generate 600 blocks wide.
  # Default: 1

  continental-scale: 100
  # Controls the scale of land / coastal / oceanic distribution. Increasing
  # this produces larger landmasses and larger oceans, and vice-versa when
  # decreasing it.
  # Default: 100

  main-end-scale: 5
  # Controls general size of the main end island.  Larger scale = larger main end island.
  # Default: 5
  
  void-buffer-scale: 20
  # Controls size of void "buffer" zone between main and outer end areas.  Larger scale = larger main end island.
  # Default: 20

  end-scale: 50
  # Controls the scale of end biomes.
  # Default: 50
  
  aether-scale: 50
  # Controls the scale of aether biomes. 
  # Default: 50

  precipitation-scale: 50
  # Controls the scale of precipitation zones. Same idea as temperature zones, where
  # humid biomes generate away from arid biomes, and biomes of similar precipitation
  # generate together.
  # Default: 50
  
  # \/ MIGHT BE USED IN THE FUTURE \/

  # temperature-scale: 60
  # Controls the scale of temperature zones. Most biomes are placed according to
  # a temperature map so hot biomes can't generate next to cold biomes, as well as
  # allowing for biomes of similar temperatures to generate together. Increasing this
  # will increase the distance between temperature changes, which results in things like
  # hot and cold biomes generating further apart - and vice versa when decreasing it.
  # Default: 60
  
  

  # elevation-scale: 35
  # Controls the scale of elevation zones. Most land biomes belong to
  # an elevation zone, in addition to temperature and precipitation. How far apart / close
  # together these elevation zones are is determined by this parameter. If you want more
  # gradual changes in the groupings of the elevation of biomes, you can increase this.
  # Conversely, if you want more sudden changes in elevation, you can decrease this.
  # Note - This does not affect how tall the terrain is in individual biomes, just the
  #        elevation map that distributes biomes of similar elevation together!
  # Default: 35

  # variation-scale: 60
  # Controls biome variations within each temperature + precipitation + elevation zone.
  # Some biomes belong to the same groups, and so we have an extra variation map that
  # determines which of these biomes within the same group get generated.
  # Default: 60

  # cave-biome-scale: 200
  # Controls the scale of the placement of cave biomes, larger scale = bigger areas of
  # any given cave biome, smaller scale = smaller cave biomes.
  # Default: 200
